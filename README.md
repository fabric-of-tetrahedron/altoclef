## About this fork (MiranCZ)
This fork aims to optimize `MarvionBeatMinecraftTask` (I will just refer to it as `BeatMinecraftTask`) from [Marvion's fork](https://github.com/MarvionKirito/altoclef) by trying to fix a lot of cases where the bot gets stuck and improving some of the tasks.

You can look at the [changelog](changelog.md) if you are interested.

Because I rewrote a good portion of the `BeatMinecraftTask` a lot of the config settings don't work. Although I plan to implement configs in the future of course.  

## About this fork (pama1234)

This branch will add the ability to generate Java code through LLM and inject it into the game at runtime to complete more tasks, similar to <https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager> However, it is entirely written in Java and (by hacking into the game) it can achieve tasks that are difficult for AI directly playing the game.

### The preprocessor
I am currently experimentaly using the [replay mod preprocessor](https://github.com/ReplayMod/preprocessor) to keep the mod updated across multiple versions at the same time.
The thing that is holding me back right now, is that I am using [Marvions releases for baritone](https://github.com/MarvionKirito/baritone) to go along AltoClef, so I should be able to at least keep up with [his fork](https://github.com/MarvionKirito/altoclef) for now.

## Download

**Note:** After installing, please move/delete your old baritone configurations if you have any. Preexisting baritone
configurations will interfere with altoclef and introduce bugs. This will be fixed in the future.
